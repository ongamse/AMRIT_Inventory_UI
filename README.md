### Building from source 

1. To build deployable war files
```bash
mvn -B package --file pom.xml -P <profile_name>
```

The available profiles include dev, local, test, and ci.
Refer to `src/environments/environment.ci.template` file and ensure that the right environment variables are set for the build.

Packing with `ci` profile calls `build-ci` script in `package.json`.
It creates a `environment.ci.ts` file with all environment variables used in the generated build.

### Prerequisites 
* [Inventory-API](https://github.com/PSMRI/Inventory-API) module must be running
* JDK 17.0
* Nodejs v8.9.0
